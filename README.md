# Face Recognition Software

Welcome to the Face Recognition Software, a Python application designed to detect and recognize faces in images. This software utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to identify faces with accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Detects faces within an image using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- **Face Recognition:** Recognizes known faces based on pre-trained models or custom datasets.
- **Multiple Faces:** Handles multiple faces in an image simultaneously.
- **Accuracy:** Employs robust algorithms to ensure accurate detection and recognition results.
- **Performance:** Optimized for performance, capable of processing images swiftly even with large datasets.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable for specific use cases and integration into existing projects.
